## Running this example project

### Structure

```

├── components
│ └── Permission.ts
│ └── Style.ts
├── ios
├── App.tsx
├── index.js

```

### Generate an App ID

In the next step, you need to use the App ID of your project. Follow these steps to [create an Agora project](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/manage_projects?platform=All%20Platforms) in Console and get an [App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms?platform=All%20Platforms#a-nameappidaapp-id ).

1. Go to [Console](https://dashboard.agora.io/) and click the **[Project Management](https://dashboard.agora.io/projects)** icon on the left navigation panel. 
2. Click **Create** and follow the on-screen instructions to set the project name, choose an authentication mechanism (for this project select App ID without a certificate), and Click **Submit**. 
3. On the **Project Management** page, find the **App ID** of your project. 

Check the end of document if you want to use App ID with certificate.

### Steps to run our example

* Download and extract the zip file from the master branch.
* Run npm install or use yarn to install the app dependencies in the unzipped directory.
* Navigate to `./src/App.tsx` and edit line 13 to enter your App ID that we generated.
* Connect your device and run `react-native run-android` / `react-native run-ios` to start the app.

The app uses `channel-x` as the channel name.
